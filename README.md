# Stroke-Disease-Prediction
 ABSTRACT:
 Active primary prevention and early detection of prognostic indicators are crucial since
 stroke frequently results in death or major disability. First, itâ€™s crucial to identify stroke
 precursors in real time, which manifest differently in each person, and to guarantee ex
pert care from a medical facility within the appropriate treatment window. Instead of
 f
 inding predictive markers of stroke, prior studies, however, concentrated on the de
velopment of acute treatment or advice for therapeutic management after the start of
 stroke. Image processing techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or com
putational Computed Tomography (CT) are frequently employed in studies from more
 recent years to identify and forecast prognostic signs in stroke patients. In this study,
 we propose a method that uses the preprocessed data in which we apply the machine
 learning algorithms ada boost and gradient boosting classifiers to know which algo
rithm has more accuracy in terms of predicting the stroke of the patient.

 INTRODUCTION:
 Stroke is oneoftheleadingcausesofdeathdailythroughouttheworld. Strokesurvivors

and their families may experience intense trauma that robs them of their independence.
 Adults who are affected develop difficulties, and those who are not treated at an early
 stage may even pass away. Other problems from strokes can include cardiac arrest, vi
sion loss, speech loss, walking impairment, and others.
 MOTIVATION:
 The motivation behind this project is, stroke is a medical emergency that requires ur
gent medical attention. Early detection and appropriate management are required to
 prevent further damage to the affected area. In this project, we develop algorithms that
 can predict the symptoms of the stroke from the given data set and gives the accuracy
 of the algorithms.
 PROBLEMSTATEMENT:
 the AdaBoostclassifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier model is that to overcome chal
lenges related to data quality and availability, algorithm performance, and clinical val
idation to ensure that it can be effectively used in a clinical setting to predict the likeli
hood of stroke disease in patients. Additionally, ethical considerations regarding data
 privacy and informed consent must be addressed in the development and use of the
 system.

 OBJECTIVE AND GOALS:
 The main purpose of this project we will propose a system that can predict and analyze
 the semantically interpret stroke prognostic symptoms based on machine learning.
 EXPECTEDCHALLENGES:
 The challenges anticipated during the implementation of the project include, Develop
2
ing algorithms that can predict the accuracy of the algorithms- Collecting the data,
 handling different algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed al
gorithms.

 SIGNIFICANCE:
 The significance of the project lies in its ability to provide efficient solutions. The pro
posed algorithms can be used in clinical forecasts to save time compared to other meth
ods. Here we use the pre-processed data which is removed of all the unwanted noise
 and apply the machine learning model approach for the AdaBoost and Gradient boost
ing classifier.
